 * A simple Blinn-Phong shader with two light sources.
 * This file is the vertex shader which transforms the
 * input vertex into eye coordinates and passes along
 * the vertex's color and normal to the fragment shader.
 *
 * For more information see:

 *
 * Be aware that for this course, we are limiting ourselves to
 * GLSL v.1.2. This is not at all the contemporary shading
 * programming environment, but it offers the greatest degree
 * of compatability.
 *
 * Please do not use syntax from GLSL > 1.2 for any homework
 * submission.
